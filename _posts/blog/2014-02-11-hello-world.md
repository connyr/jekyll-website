Starting a Blog. A few days ago, I realized that I had dodged this topic long enough and finally forayed into the web-development scene...
<!-- more -->

The goal? 
Creating my own web blog to share my work and thoughts. 

Until now, I've only worked with already existing webservice systems or on local implementations. So creating everything from scratch, from domain management to webhosting to front-end design, was quite a challenge for me.

For the frontend, I tried *Wordpress* at first, but quickly realized that **Bootstrap 3** and **Jekyll** were much better suited for my purposes and easier to configure as well. All of it was a good learning experience, though.

Now that everything is setup and running, what's next?

My **long term goal** is to implement the project ideas collected by [Martyr2 in the programmers idea book](http://www.coderslexicon.com/downloads/the-programmers-idea-book/). The language I plan to use for this is *Objective-C* in combination with *iOS*. Why you might ask? I feel comfortable with Objective-C and the iOS framework provides an easy way to implement necessary user interfaces.

With this I can get more experience developing projects from various genres, and also amass more knowledge on *iOS programming*. 
I also hope, that by working through the (quite long) project list, at the end I will have a better grasp on some basic programming concepts, which might have been forgotten or gotten rusted.
