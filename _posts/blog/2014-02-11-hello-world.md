Finally got around to start a blog. A few days ago, I realized that I had dodged this topic long enough and forayed into web-development
<!-- more -->

The goal? 
Create a web blog to share my work and thoughts. 

Until now, I've often worked on projects with already existing webservice systems. Creating everything from scratch, from domain management to webhosting to front-end design, was wonderful new challenge for me.

For the frontend, I tried *Wordpress* at first, but quickly realized that **Bootstrap 3** and **Jekyll** were much better suited for my purposes and easier to configure as well. All of it was a good learning experience, though.

Now that everything is setup and running, what's next?

My **long term goal** is to implement the project ideas collected by [Martyr2 in the programmers idea book](http://www.coderslexicon.com/downloads/the-programmers-idea-book/). The language I currently plan to use for this is *Objective-C* in combination with *iOS*. Why choose that? I feel comfortable with objective-C and the iOS framework provides an easy way to implement fast user interfaces.

With this, I hope to get more experience on projects from various genres, and also gain more skills in *iOS programming*. 
By working through the (quite long) project list, I hope that at the end I will have a better grasp on some basic programming concepts, which might be a bit rusted now.
