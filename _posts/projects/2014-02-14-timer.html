<h4>Description</h4>
<div class="hline"></div>

<p>Countdown timer and stopwatch similar to apple's included clock app.
    <br><br>
        <b>Timer</b> uses the UIDatePicker to set up the alarm time and counts down until it reaches zero. It also continues counting (for some time) when the app enters the background and uses a UILocalNotification to alert the user when the time has run out and plays a sound.
        <br>
    <b>Stopwatch</b> can recored lap times, and the usual play, pause, resume and reset functionalities. It also continues running for some time, after the app enters the background.
